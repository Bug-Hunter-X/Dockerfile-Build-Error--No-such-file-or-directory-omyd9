This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: attempting to copy a file that doesn't exist in the context.  The original Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) attempts to copy `requirements.txt`, but this file is not present. The solution (`DockerfileFixed`) shows how to properly handle this.  The issue is addressed by ensuring the `requirements.txt` file exists before the `COPY` command.
